    "- <b>Log link:</b> the link to your ban log (from @TranssionCoreFederationLogs)\n"
    "- <b>Clarification:</b> your honest explanation of what happened\n"
    "- <b>Agreement:</b> your commitment not to repeat the violation\n\n"

    "Log link: https://t.me/TranssionCoreFederationLogs/123\n"

    "Your appeal is forwarded to TC admins for review. The admin who issued the ban has "
    "<b>12 hours</b> to respond — after that, any admin can approve or reject it.\n"
    "If approved → ban is lifted immediately.\n"
    "If rejected → ban stays. You'll be notified either way."
