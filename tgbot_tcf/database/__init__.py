"""Database package: connection, collection handles, and per-collection repos.

Two import styles are supported, depending on how much abstraction the caller
wants:

* **Raw collection handles.** Importing the lower-case names exported here
  (``federated_groups``, ``tc_admins``, ``bans`` …) yields the underlying
  ``AsyncIOMotorCollection`` objects defined in :mod:`.mongo`. Use this when
  a query is one-off or genuinely ad hoc.

* **Repository helpers.** Each collection also has a focused module
  (:mod:`.bans`, :mod:`.groups`, :mod:`.admins`, :mod:`.requests`,
  :mod:`.joins`, :mod:`.members`) that exposes named, typed accessors such as
  :func:`bans_repo.find_active_for_user`. Higher-level code in
  :mod:`tgbot_tcf.modules` uses these so query intent is documented in code.
