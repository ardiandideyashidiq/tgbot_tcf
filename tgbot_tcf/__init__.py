    "security and a conducive environment so members can discuss comfortably.\n\n"
    "<i>TCF is not an official part of Transsion Holdings. This is strictly an "
    "independent community.</i>\n\n"
    "<b>History</b>\n"
    "Established in 2024. Originally named TFI, but it was disbanded due to "
    "internal issues. Shortly after, TCF was formed to continue managing the "
    "community with better stability."
