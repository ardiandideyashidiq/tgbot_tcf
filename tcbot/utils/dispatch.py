"""
Throttled multi-group dispatcher

fan_out(coros) - run many coroutines concurrently, bounded by a semaphore so
the bot never fires more than MAX_CONCURRENT Telegram API calls simultaneously.

Telegram's documented hard limits (per bot):
    • 30 messages / second across all chats combined
    • 1 message  / second per individual chat
Capping at 10 concurrent calls keeps us well inside those ceilings even on
large federations, while being orders of magnitude faster than a sequential loop.
All exceptions are captured in-place - a single failed group never blocks the rest.
