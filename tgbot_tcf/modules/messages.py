"""Single source of truth for every user-facing string the bot emits.

All copy is grouped under one :class:`Messages` namespace exported as ``M``.
Two principles guide the wording here:

1. **Spec-locked strings** – text that the PROMPT specification fixes
   verbatim (for example ``"You are not authorized."`` or ``"Cannot resolve
   user."``) must remain byte-for-byte identical so the contract with the
   federation tooling stays intact.
2. **Friendly-yet-formal tone** – every other string is phrased with warmth
   and respect: clear sentences, full punctuation, no slang, no emoji, no
   stiff phrasing. The aim is to sound like a thoughtful operations partner.

Curly-brace placeholders (``{name}``) are filled with :py:meth:`str.format`
or f-string substitution at the call site. HTML segments stay valid HTML
because every reply that uses these strings sets ``parse_mode=HTML``.
