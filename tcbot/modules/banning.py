    "If the user is already banned, the existing record gets updated with the new reason and proof.\n\n"

    "<b>How to specify the target</b>\n"
    "Reply to a message, or provide a user ID / @username.\n\n"

    "<b>Examples</b>\n"
    "<code>/tcban @username spamming affiliate links</code>\n"
    "<code>/tcban 123456789 scamming members</code>\n"
    "Or reply to a message, then: <code>/tcb reason here</code>"
