Build a production-ready Telegram bot for the Transsion Core Federation (TCF) according to the following exhaustive specification.

- The bot manages Transsion Core membership
- Fully automatic ban/unban with proof uploads and immediate cross‑group enforcement.

All code must be written in:
- Python 3.11+ 
- python-telegram-bot library version 22.5
- MongoDB as the database with the motor async driver.

The bot must be runnable via "python -m tcbot" and include a Flask keep-alive server on port 8080. No emoji is allowed in any message, caption, or button.
All formatted messages must use HTML parse mode.

CREDENTIALS (provided as environment variables; values given here for reference):
- BOT_TOKEN = 8704305954:AAGN9Dd1fTpzQnjvDPMGZa86p0jkXCSykjc
- MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://TCF:TCF@clusterfed.c7vnwkg.mongodb.net/?appName=ClusterFed
- Database name: tcf_bot

HARDCODED TELEGRAM IDs (use exactly):
- LOG_CHANNEL = -1003941141635   (all Transsion Core events are logged here)
- MAIN_GROUP = -1003872207988    (forum group containing proof and appeal topics)
- PROOF_TOPIC = 67              (thread inside MAIN_GROUP for ban proof uploads)
- APPEAL_TOPIC = 12             (thread inside MAIN_GROUP for appeal submissions)
- APPEAL_DISCUSSION_TOPIC = 11  (thread inside MAIN_GROUP where admins review and decide on appeals)
- MAIN_CHANNEL = -1003852970764 (reference only, not used)
- EXEC_GROUP = -1002333013065   (executive group; welcome/goodbye messages are also sent here)
- INITIAL_OWNER_ID = 7146954165 (user ID that becomes the first Transsion Core Owner if tc_owners is empty)

PROJECT STRUCTURE
The code must be organized into a clean, modular structure. The entry point is tgbot_tcf/__main__.py, with sub-packages for database, handlers, utilities, etc. You are free to name the packages, but the structure must be logical and production-ready.

DATABASE SCHEMA (MongoDB collections)
- federated_groups: { chat_id: int, title: str, added_by: int (user_id), added_date: datetime, is_active: bool }
- tc_owners: { user_id: int }  (exactly one document after the first owner is set)
- tc_admins: { user_id: int, promoted_by: int, promoted_date: datetime }
- bans: { ban_id: str (unique), banned_user_id: int, reason: str, admin_user_id: int, proof_message_id: int, log_message_id: int, previous_proof_message_id: int | null, previous_log_message_id: int | null, timestamp: datetime, updated_timestamp: datetime | null, is_active: bool, update_count: int, review_message_id: int | null, review_timestamp: datetime | null }
- promotion_requests: { request_id: str (unique), target_id: int, promoted_by: int, status: str (pending/approved/rejected), requested_date: datetime, resolved_date: datetime | null, resolved_by: int | null }
- pending_joins: { chat_id: int, title: str, owner_id: int, message_id: int, added_date: datetime }
- member_cache: { user_id: int, username: str | null, first_name: str, last_name: str | null, last_updated: datetime }

TARGET RESOLUTION (used by every command that takes a target)
1. If the command is a reply, target = replied-to user.
2. If the first argument is a numeric string, treat it as a user ID and call get_chat.
3. Otherwise, treat it as a username (strip @ if present) and call get_chat.
4. If no target can be resolved, reply "Cannot resolve user."

COMMAND PREFIXES
All commands must work with the following prefixes: `/` `.` `!`
Example: /tcban, .tcban, !tcban all trigger the same ban command.
Register handlers to accept messages starting with any of these prefixes for all commands and their aliases.

AUTHORIZATION
Commands /tcban, /tcunban, /tcpromote, /tcdemote, /tctransfer, /tcbroadcast, /rmtc, /jointc, /leaveall, /cleanup require the sender to be in tc_owners or tc_admins. Otherwise reply "You are not authorized."
For /tcban and /tcunban, authorization is checked purely against the tc_owners/tc_admins collections. The TC admin/owner **does not need to be an admin of the chat** where the command is executed. These commands work in any affiliated group, in the MAIN_GROUP (or its topics), in the EXEC_GROUP, or in bot PM.
For /tcpromote: TC admins can initiate the command, but it only creates a promotion request. The owner must approve or reject it.

BAN PROTECTION
Before executing /tcban, check if the target user is in tc_owners or tc_admins. If yes, reply "Cannot ban a Transsion Core Admin or Owner." and stop.

SELF‑TARGET PREVENTION
- /tcban: if target is sender → reply "You cannot ban yourself."
- /tcunban: if target is sender → reply "You are not banned, or you cannot unban yourself."
- /tcpromote: if target is sender → reply "You cannot promote yourself."
- /tcdemote: if target is sender → reply "I cannot demote myself. I hold a crucial position in this Transsion Core. Please ask the owner to do it."
- /tctransfer: if target is sender → reply "You are already the owner." (if sender is owner) / "Only the owner can use this command." (if not owner)
- /jointc: if sender is already owner of a federated group → reply "Already affiliated."

COMMON RESPONSES
- "Cannot resolve user." – when target resolution fails.
- "User is not banned." – when no active ban found.
- "Already a Transsion Core Admin." – when target already in tc_admins.
- "Not a Transsion Core Admin." – when target not in tc_admins.
- "Invalid or expired ban." – when ban not found/inactive in appeal.
- "This group is not affiliated with TCF." – when running /detc in non‑federated group.
- "Only the group owner or Transsion Core admins can disaffiliate this group." – /detc unauthorized.

WORKFLOW OVERVIEW (Ban / Appeal / Unban / Promotion interactions / Member Tracking)
- A ban is created via /tcban, stored as active. The bot **immediately** iterates over all active federated_groups and bans the target user wherever it has can_restrict_members permission. No manual sync command exists; enforcement is fully automatic.
- Unban via /tcunban sets the ban inactive immediately and also immediately unbans the user across all groups.
- When an appeal is approved, the ban is automatically lifted (unban) and the same cross‑group unban enforcement is executed.
- The appeal review message is persisted in the ban record (review_message_id, review_timestamp).
- All state changes are logged to LOG_CHANNEL.
- TC admins can promote other users via /tcpromote, but it creates a promotion request; the owner must approve.
- **Member Tracking**: When the bot joins a new affiliated group, it fetches all current members and stores their user_id, username, first_name, last_name in `member_cache`. On every message received in any affiliated group, the sender's data is updated in `member_cache`. Additionally, on `chat_member` updates (when a user changes their info), the bot updates the cache accordingly. This ensures the bot always has the latest username/nickname for identification in logs.

FEATURE 1: GROUP AFFILIATION ON BOT ADD (with real‑time admin right monitoring)
1. When the bot is added to a group (new_chat_members includes bot, chat.type is group/supergroup), send immediately:
   "Do you want this community to join the Transsion Core Federation?"
   with inline buttons in one row:
   - "Join Transsion Core" | "Cancel"
   "Join Transsion Core" -> callback_data = "tc_join"
   "Cancel" -> callback_data = "tc_cancel"
2. Only the group owner (status "creator") may interact. On any callback:
   - Retrieve chat_member for the clicking user.
   - If status != "creator", answer callback with alert "Only the group owner can decide." (show_alert=True). Do nothing else.
3. Owner clicks "Join Transsion Core":
   a. Check bot's own permissions in the chat via get_chat_member(chat_id, bot_id). Required:
      - can_delete_messages = True
      - can_restrict_members = True
      - can_invite_users = True
   b. If any missing:
      - Edit original message to: "Please make the bot an admin with the necessary permissions (delete messages, ban users, invite users) and try again."
      - Remove the inline keyboard.
      - Store this chat in `pending_joins` with { chat_id, title, owner_id, message_id: the sent message's id, added_date: now }.
      - Start monitoring `my_chat_member` updates for this chat. When the bot's permissions become sufficient, the join will be completed automatically (see step 5).
      - Stop here.
   c. If permissions are sufficient:
      - If chat already in federated_groups with is_active=true, edit message to "Already affiliated." Remove keyboard. Stop.
      - Otherwise, upsert federated_groups with { chat_id, title, added_by: owner_id, added_date: utcnow(), is_active: true }.
      - If tc_owners is empty, insert { user_id: INITIAL_OWNER_ID } as the first Transsion Core Owner.
      - Edit message to "This community is now affiliated with TCF. Federation commands can now be used here by authorized Transsion Core admins." Remove keyboard.
      - Log to LOG_CHANNEL (HTML, no buttons):
        ```
        New Affiliated Group
        𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

        Group: <group_display>
        ID: <chat_id>

        Added by Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<owner_id>">Owner First Name</a>
        ID: <owner_id>

        Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>
        ```
        where <group_display> is:
        - If chat has a public username: <a href="https://t.me/username">chat_title</a>
        - Otherwise: just chat_title
      - Remove any pending_joins record for this chat.
      - Trigger full member cache initialisation for this group (see Feature 33).

4. Owner clicks "Cancel":
   a. Edit message to "Affiliation cancelled. Leaving the group." Remove keyboard.
   b. Leave the group using context.bot.leave_chat(chat_id). Handle exceptions silently.
   c. Log to LOG_CHANNEL:
      ```
      Affiliation Rejected & Left

      𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

      Group: <chat_title> (ID: <chat_id>)

      Rejected by Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<owner_id>">Owner First Name</a> (ID: <owner_id>)

      Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>
      ```
      Remove any pending_joins record for this chat.

5. Real‑time monitoring of bot admin rights for pending joins:
   - Listen to `my_chat_member` updates. When the bot's new status is administrator and the chat is in `pending_joins`, check if the required permissions (can_delete_messages, can_restrict_members, can_invite_users) are now all True.
   - If yes, perform the full join as in step 3.c, but edit the stored message_id to the success message instead of sending a new one.
   - Remove the pending_joins record.

FEATURE 2: EXPLICIT JOIN TRANSSION CORE LATER (/jointc, /requestjoin, /applytc)
- If a group previously rejected or did not join when the bot was added, the group owner can later use /jointc in the group where the bot is already an admin.
- The bot will re-check its permissions (same as Feature 1 step 3a). If permissions missing, reply "Please make the bot an admin with the necessary permissions (delete messages, ban users, invite users) and try again."
- If permissions OK, perform the same upsert into federated_groups (if already active, reply "Already affiliated."). Set is_active=true. If tc_owners empty, insert { user_id: INITIAL_OWNER_ID }.
- Reply "This community is now affiliated with TCF."
- Log same as New Affiliated Group (Feature 1).

FEATURE 3: DISAFFILIATE A GROUP (multiple aliases)
- /detc, /leavetc, /untc (inside a federated group):
  - Check if chat is active in federated_groups; if not, reply "This group is not affiliated with TCF."
  - If sender is group owner OR TC owner/admin:
    - Set is_active = false for chat in federated_groups.
    - Reply "This group has been removed from the Transsion Core Federation."
    - Try context.bot.leave_chat(chat_id).
    - Log:

      Log Message:
      Group Disaffiliated
      𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

      Group: <chat_title>
      ID: <chat_id>

      Removed by: <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a>
      ID: <user_id>

      Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

  - Otherwise reply "Only the group owner or Transsion Core admins can disaffiliate this group."

- /rmtc, /removetc, /deletetc <group_id> (any chat, only TC owner/admins):
  - Find active group by chat_id. If not found, reply "Group not found or already removed."
  - Set is_active=false, try to leave, reply "Group <group_id> has been removed from the federation."
  - Log similar to above (same Log Message format).

FEATURE 4: TRANSSION CORE OWNER AND ADMIN MANAGEMENT (with Promotion Request)
- /tcpromote, /promote, /tcfpromote <target> (TC admins or owner can use, but behavior depends on role):
  - If no target, reply "Reply to a user, provide a user ID, or provide a username to promote."
  - Resolve target. If target is sender (self-promote), reply "You cannot promote yourself."
  - If already a TC admin, reply "Already a Transsion Core Admin."
  - IF the sender is the OWNER:
    - Immediately add to tc_admins. Reply "User <user_id> is now a Transsion Core Admin."
    - Log directly as "New Transsion Core Admin Promoted".
  - IF the sender is a TC ADMIN (not owner):
    - Create a promotion request in `promotion_requests` with status="pending".
    - Reply "Promotion request for <user_id> has been sent to the Transsion Core Owner for approval."
    - Notify the owner: first try PM, if fails (exception), send to LOG_CHANNEL with owner mention. The notification contains request details and inline buttons: "Approve" (callback: `approve_promote_<request_id>`) | "Reject" (callback: `reject_promote_<request_id>`).
    - The owner can click to approve/reject. Edit the notification message, remove keyboard.
    - If approved: add to tc_admins, log as "New Transsion Core Admin Promoted".
    - If rejected: log as "Promotion Request Rejected".
    - Log format for request sent / approved / rejected must include relevant details.

- /tcdemote, /demote, /tcfdemote <target> (Owner only):
  - If no target, reply "Reply to a user, provide a user ID, or provide a username to demote."
  - Resolve target. If target is owner, reply "Cannot demote the Transsion Core Owner."
  - If target is sender (self-demote), reply "I cannot demote myself. I hold a crucial position in this Transsion Core. Please ask the owner to do it."
  - Remove from tc_admins. Reply "User demoted from Transsion Core Admin." or "Not a Transsion Core Admin."
  - Log:

        Log Message:
        Transsion Core Admin Demoted
        𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

        Admin: <a href="tg://user?id=<target_id>">Target First Name</a>
        ID: <target_id>

        Demoted by Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<owner_id>">Owner First Name</a>
        ID: <owner_id>

        Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

- /tctransfer, /transfer, /tcowner <target> (Owner only):
  - If no target, reply "Reply to a user, provide a user ID, or provide a username to transfer ownership to."
  - Resolve target. If target is sender (self-transfer), reply "You are already the owner."
  - Move ownership: update tc_owners, old owner becomes a regular admin (tc_admins entry if not already there).
  - Reply "Ownership transferred to <user_id>."
  - Log:

    Log Message:
    Transsion Core Ownership Transferred
    𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

    New Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<target_id>">Target First Name</a>
    ID: <target_id>

    Previous Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<old_owner_id>">Old Owner First Name</a>
    ID: <old_owner_id>

    Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

FEATURE 5: TRANSSION CORE BAN (/tcban, /ban, /tcfban) WITH PROOF AND IMMEDIATE CROSS‑GROUP ENFORCEMENT
Only TC owner/admins. Usage: /tcban <target> <reason> (reason required). Works in any affiliated group, in the MAIN_GROUP (forum), in the EXEC_GROUP, or in bot PM.
Implement with ConversationHandler (60-second timeout per step).

**Automatic ban enforcement logic**:
- After the ban record is saved, the bot **immediately** iterates over all active federated_groups. In each group where the bot has can_restrict_members permission (checked via get_chat_member for the bot), call bot.ban_chat_member(chat_id, target_id). Catch and ignore exceptions (e.g., if the target is an admin in that group and cannot be banned by the bot). This makes the ban effective across the entire federation without any manual sync command.
- The ban record is stored in the bans collection.

1. Entry: Bot replies to command with a message containing:
   - Text: "Please provide proof for this ban. Send a photo or video (multiple media allowed). You have 60 seconds."
   - Inline keyboard with one button: "Cancel" (callback_data="cancel_proof")
   Store sent message ID for later editing.

2. State WAITING_PROOF:
   - If the user clicks the "Cancel" button (callback_data="cancel_proof"):
     - Edit the message to "Operation cancelled." and remove keyboard.
     - End the conversation.
   - Accept photo, video, or media_group_id (album).
     - For media groups: collect messages by media_group_id. Set a 2-second asyncio task (or JobQueue) that fires when no new media for that group arrives; process all accumulated media as one album.
   - Any other message type -> reply "Only photos and videos allowed." and stay in state.
   - Timeout (60s): edit the prompt message to "Proof submission timed out." and remove keyboard, then exit conversation.

3. When media collected:
   - Determine if target already actively banned (is_active=true). If yes -> UPDATE, else NEW.
   - Generate unique ban_id = f"{target.id}_{int(datetime.utcnow().timestamp())}".
   - Upload media to MAIN_GROUP, message_thread_id=PROOF_TOPIC (67):
     * Single: send_photo/send_video with caption according to templates below.
     * Album: send_media_group with InputMediaPhoto/InputMediaVideo; first item gets caption, rest caption=None.
   - Capture first message_id as proof_message_id. Construct proof link: https://t.me/c/3872207988/<proof_message_id>?thread=67
   - Send log message to LOG_CHANNEL (no thread) with HTML and inline keyboard (see templates). Capture log_message_id.
   - Save/update ban record in bans collection.
   - **Enforce ban across all groups**: For each active federated group, if bot has can_restrict_members, ban_chat_member(chat_id, target_id). Catch and ignore exceptions silently.
   - Edit the initial prompt message to: "User <banned_user_id> has been banned from the Transsion Core. Reason: <reason>" and remove the Cancel button.
   - End conversation.

Templates for NEW BAN (in MAIN_GROUP proof topic):

Row 2: "Submit Appeal" url = https://t.me/<bot_username>?start=appeal_<ban_id>

Note: In log messages for both new and update bans, the "Submit Appeal" button must always be present.

BAN RECORD UPDATE LOGIC:
On update: set previous_proof_message_id = old proof_message_id, previous_log_message_id = old log_message_id, then overwrite with new IDs. Increment update_count, set updated_timestamp. Keep original timestamp and is_active unchanged.

FEATURE 6: TRANSSION CORE UNBAN (/tcunban, /unban, /tcfunban)
- Only TC owner/admins. Usage: /tcunban <target> [optional reason]. Works in any affiliated group, in the MAIN_GROUP (forum), in the EXEC_GROUP, or in bot PM. The executor does not need to be an admin of the chat.
- Resolve target. If target is sender (self-unban), reply "You are not banned, or you cannot unban yourself."
- Find active ban by banned_user_id. If none, reply "User is not banned."
- Unban also occurs automatically when an appeal is approved (see Feature 8).
- Set is_active = false.
- **Immediately unban across all groups**: For each active federated group where bot has can_restrict_members, call unban_chat_member(chat_id, target_id). Catch and ignore exceptions.
- If an optional reason was given, include it in the log (append after the Admin/User lines: "Unban Reason: <reason>").
- If a pending appeal exists for this ban (review_message_id is not null), the bot edits that review message to "Appeal resolved (user already unbanned)." and removes the keyboard.
- Log to LOG_CHANNEL:

  Log Message:
  Transsion Core Unban
  𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

  Admin: <a href="tg://user?id=<admin_id>">Admin First Name</a>

  User ID: <target_id>

  [Unban Reason: <reason>] (if provided)

  Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

- Reply to issuer: "User <target_id> has been unbanned from the Transsion Core."

FEATURE 7: CHECK BAN STATUS (/checkme, /myban, /amibanned)
- Any user, any chat. Query bans for sender.id, is_active=true.
- If banned:
  You are currently banned from Transsion Core.
  Reason: <reason>
  Banned by Transsion Core Admin: <admin first name>
  + inline button: "Submit Appeal" url = https://t.me/<bot_username>?start=appeal_<ban_id>
- If not banned: "You are not banned in the Transsion Core."

FEATURE 8: APPEAL SYSTEM (with Cancel button, Admin Review, and detailed Help)
- Deep link: /start appeal_<ban_id> (private chat only). Also accessible via "Submit Appeal" button in ban logs.
1. Find ban by ban_id. If not found or not active, reply "Invalid or expired ban."
2. Send the exactly specified appeal instruction text (the text starting with "Transsion Core [Group]:" and ending with "Log Channel: @TranssionCoreFederationLogs"). No emoji. At the bottom of this message, add an inline button "Cancel" with callback_data="cancel_appeal".
3. Enter state WAITING_APPEAL. Accept only messages starting with "#appeal". All other messages are ignored silently.
4. If the user clicks "Cancel":
   - Edit the instruction message to "Appeal cancelled." and remove the keyboard.
   - End the conversation.
5. When a #appeal message received:
   - Parse lines: Log link, Clarification, Agreement (each on a new line with labels).
   - Validate that the log link contains the stored log_message_id. If mismatch, reply "Invalid log link. Please check and try again." and stay in state (keep the Cancel button on the instruction message).
   - If valid:
     a. Post the entire raw appeal message to MAIN_GROUP, message_thread_id=APPEAL_TOPIC (12). This is a plain text message; no extra formatting. Capture its message_id as appeal_message_id.
     b. Construct appeal link: https://t.me/c/3872207988/<appeal_message_id>?thread=12
     c. Send an appeal review message to MAIN_GROUP, message_thread_id=APPEAL_DISCUSSION_TOPIC (11) with the following format (HTML) and inline keyboard (single row, Approve | Reject):
        ```
        New Appeal Request
        User: <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a> (ID: <user_id>)
        Ban ID: <ban_id>
        Appeal: <appeal_link>
        Submitted: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

        This appeal is pending review. 
        ```
        Inline keyboard in one row:
        - "Approve" (callback_data="appeal_approve_<ban_id>") | "Reject" (callback_data="appeal_reject_<ban_id>")
        Capture the message_id of this review message. Update the ban record: set review_message_id = this message_id, review_timestamp = now (UTC).
     d. Edit the instruction message to "Your appeal has been submitted. Transsion Core admins will review it." and remove keyboard.
     e. Log to LOG_CHANNEL:

        Log Message:
        New Appeal Submitted
        𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯
        
        User: <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a>
        ID: <user_id>
        
        Ban ID: <ban_id>
        Appeal: <appeal_link>
        
        Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>

     f. End conversation.

6. Appeal Review Callback Handling:
   - When an admin clicks "Approve" or "Reject" on the review message (thread 11):
     - Verify the clicking user is a TC owner or TC admin.
     - If not authorized, answer callback with alert "You are not authorized." and do nothing.
     - Retrieve the ban record by ban_id. If ban is no longer active, answer callback "This ban is already inactive." and edit the review message to "Appeal resolved (ban no longer active)." remove keyboard.
     - Determine the time elapsed since the review_timestamp. If elapsed time is less than 12 hours, only the original banning admin (ban.admin_user_id) may click the buttons. If the clicking user is not the original banning admin, answer callback with alert "Only the banning admin can review within the first 12 hours." and do nothing.
     - If elapsed time >= 12 hours, any TC admin/owner may click.
     - Process decision:
       * If "Approve":
         - Set ban.is_active = false (unban) and update the ban record.
         - **Enforce unban across all groups**: For each active federated group where bot has can_restrict_members, call unban_chat_member(chat_id, ban.banned_user_id). Catch and ignore exceptions.
         - Edit the review message to "Appeal approved by <a href="tg://user?id=<admin_id>">Admin First Name</a>. User has been unbanned." and remove keyboard.
         - Log to LOG_CHANNEL:
           Log Message:
           Appeal Approved
           𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯
           
           User: <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a>
           ID: <user_id>
           
           Ban ID: <ban_id>
           Approved by: <a href="tg://user?id=<admin_id>">Admin First Name</a>
           
           Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>
         - Optionally notify the user in PM that their appeal was approved and they are now unbanned.
       * If "Reject":
         - Edit the review message to "Appeal rejected by <a href="tg://user?id=<admin_id>">Admin First Name</a>." and remove keyboard.
         - Log to LOG_CHANNEL:
           Log Message:
           Appeal Rejected
           𝘛𝘊𝘍 - 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯
           
           User: <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a>
           ID: <user_id>

           Ban ID: <ban_id>

           Rejected by: <a href="tg://user?id=<admin_id>">Admin First Name</a>

           Date: <DD-MM-YYYY> | <HH:MM>
         - Optionally notify the user in PM that their appeal was rejected.
   - Answer all callback queries appropriately. If the ban becomes inactive before review (e.g., manually unbanned), the review message should be edited to "Appeal resolved (user already unbanned)." and keyboard removed. This check should be done on each callback as well.

FEATURE 17: ABOUT TCF (deep link and start menu)
- Deep link: /start about. Sends formatted text.
- Start menu button "About" also shows this text.
- Formatted text (HTML):
  <b>What is TCF?</b>
  Transsion Core Federation (TCF) is a community-driven federation for Infinix, Tecno, and Itel groups. Our main focus is maintaining group security and a conducive environment so members can discuss comfortably.
  <i>TCF is not an official part of Transsion Holdings. This is strictly an independent community.</i>

  <b>History</b>
  Established in 2024. Originally named TFI, but it was disbanded due to internal issues. Shortly after, TCF was formed to continue managing the community with better stability.

FEATURE 18: TRANSSION CORE LINKS (/tclinks, /links, /tcconfig) - now "Additional" in start menu
- Start menu button: "Additional" -> shows this.
- Text (HTML, no emoji):
  <b>Transsion Core Federation - Official Links</b>
  Use the buttons below to access our channels and groups. For developers interested in contributing to Transsion device development, join TRAVEL - an independent community for collaboration and networking.

- Inline keyboard (2 buttons per row):
  Row 1: "Main Channel" (url: t.me/TranssionCoreFederation) | "Discussion Group" (url: t.me/TranssionCoreFederationGroup)
  Row 2: "Logs Channel" (url: t.me/TranssionCoreFederationLogs) | "Exec Group" (url: https://t.me/+A105pfnCvkhiZWM1)
  Row 3: "TRAVEL (Dev Community)" (url: http://t.me/+S2C_ppFvHlAwMzNl)

FEATURE 19: HELP COMMAND (/help, /commands, /start without deep link)
- Sends a message summarizing bot capabilities (design professionally, no emoji). Then show an inline keyboard with modules.
- Example text: "<b>TCF Bot Help</b>\nI manage Transsion Core groups, bans, appeals, and more. Select a topic below:"
- Inline buttons (2 per row):
  Row 1: "Ban" | "Unban"
  Row 2: "Check Ban" | "Ban Info"
  Row 3: "Promote/Demote" | "Transfer Owner"
  Row 4: "Broadcast" | "Appeal"
  Row 5: "Group Affiliation" | "Disaffiliate"
  Row 6: "Cleanup" | "Join/Leave"
  Row 7: "Statistics"
- Detail pages for each module, with clear syntax, aliases, who can use, and where it works. "Back" button to module list.
- For the "Appeal" module, the detail page must explain:
  * If you are banned, you can submit an appeal by clicking "Submit Appeal" on the ban log message in @TranssionCoreFederationLogs, or by using the deep link /start appeal_<ban_id>.
  * The bot will send you an instruction message. You must reply with a message starting with #appeal, containing the Log link, your Clarification, and an Agreement.
  * Example: #appeal\nLog link: https://t.me/TranssionCoreFederationLogs/1\nClarification: I spammed unintentionally.\nAgreement: I will not use automation tools again.
  * Your appeal will be reviewed by Transsion Core admins. The banning admin has 12 hours to decide; after that, any admin can approve or reject it.
  * If approved, the ban is lifted; if rejected, the ban remains. You will be notified of the decision.

FEATURE 20: MESSAGE EDITING BEHAVIOUR
- Prefer editing existing bot messages instead of sending new ones, unless a new message is explicitly required.
- Use try-except to ignore "Message is not modified" errors.

FEATURE 21: ERROR HANDLING AND LOGGING
- Use Python logging module (INFO). All handlers must catch exceptions to avoid crashes; log full tracebacks.

FEATURE 22: KEEP-ALIVE SERVER
- Minimal Flask app listening on 0.0.0.0:8080, returns "OK" on /. Start in daemon thread before run_polling().

FEATURE 23: BOT STARTUP
- In __main__.py: load env vars (BOT_TOKEN, MONGODB_URI), connect MongoDB, build Application with all handlers (command handlers for each alias with all prefix support, conversation handlers, callback handlers, chat member update handler, error handler), start keep-alive thread, run_polling(allowed_updates=Update.ALL_TYPES).

FEATURE 24: START MESSAGE & MAIN MENU
- When a user sends /start in private chat (no deep link), send a welcome message designed for TCF. Keep it short, friendly, and professional with HTML formatting.
  Example text:
  <b>Hey There! My Name is TC-Bot.</b>
  I help manage Transsion Core groups, bans, and appeals. Use the buttons below to learn more or view important links.

- Inline keyboard (2 buttons per row):
  Row 1: "About" (callback_data="menu_about") | "Help" (callback_data="menu_help")
  Row 2: "Groups" (callback_data="menu_groups") | "Additional" (callback_data="menu_additional")
  Row 3: "Information" (callback_data="menu_information")
  Row 4: "Privacy" (callback_data="menu_privacy")

- Button behavior (all edits the message, adds "Back" button to start):
  - "About": Show formatted text from Feature 17. Back button.
  - "Help": Open interactive help (Feature 19/25). Top-level has Back to start.
  - "Groups": Show active federated groups (paginated, 10 per page). Back button.
  - "Additional": Show Transsion Core Links (Feature 18). Back button.
  - "Information": Show a summary of Transsion Core Information and two sub-buttons.
  - "Privacy": Show privacy options as defined in Feature 32.

- "Information" sub-menu content:
  Message text (HTML):
  <b>Transsion Core Information</b>
  Owner: <a href="tg://user?id=<owner_id>">Owner Name</a>
  Admins: <count>
  Active Bans: <count>
  Connected Chats: <count>

  Inline keyboard:
  Row 1: "Admins" (callback_data="info_admins") | "Connected Chats" (callback_data="info_chats")
  Row 2: "Back" (callback_data="menu_back_start")

  *   "Admins": Shows list of TC admins (up to 10 per page), with Next/Previous if needed. "Back" returns to Information.
  *   "Connected Chats": Shows list of active groups (10 per page), with Next/Previous if needed. "Back" returns to Information.
  (For private groups, just display title and ID, no clickable link or a tg:// link if available).

FEATURE 25: INTERACTIVE HELP SYSTEM (accessed from start menu)
- Same structure as /help but with "Back" buttons leading to the main start menu.

FEATURE 26: INLINE KEYBOARD LAYOUT RULES
- All inline keyboards must be arranged efficiently:
  * Menus with multiple items: 2 buttons per row.
  * Confirmation actions (Approve/Reject, Join/Cancel): both buttons in the same row.
  * A single button (Back, Cancel) may occupy one row alone.
  * Never use one button per row for lists longer than 2 items.
  * Pagination buttons (Next/Previous) can be in one row.

FEATURE 27: WELCOME & GOODBYE MESSAGES IN MAIN_GROUP AND EXEC_GROUP
- When a new member joins MAIN_GROUP (chat_id = -1003872207988) or EXEC_GROUP (chat_id = -1002333013065), send a welcome message (HTML, no emoji):
  <b>Welcome to <i><group_title></i>, <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a>!</b>
  We're glad to have you here. This is an official group of the Transsion Core Federation. Please take a moment to review the group rules and feel free to introduce yourself.

  If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask our admins.

  Enjoy your stay!

  Inline button: "What is TCF?" (url: https://t.me/<bot_username>?start=about)

- When a member leaves MAIN_GROUP or EXEC_GROUP, send goodbye (HTML):
  <a href="tg://user?id=<user_id>">User First Name</a> has left the group. We're sad to see you go! If you ever wish to rejoin, you're always welcome back.

- The bot must only send these messages in exactly those two groups. No welcome/goodbye in other groups.

FEATURE 28: TRAVEL INFORMATION (static)
- TRAVEL (Transsion Holding's Development) is an independent community for developers and contributors involved with Transsion devices. Anyone with skills, potential, or strong determination to contribute to Transsion device development is welcome to join. The invite link is http://t.me/+S2C_ppFvHlAwMzNl. This information is referenced in FEATURE 18 and optionally elsewhere, but not in welcome messages.

FEATURE 29: PROMOTION REQUESTS COMMAND (/tcpromoterequests, /promoreqs, /tcreqs)
- Only TC owner can use. Fetches all promotion_requests with status "pending". Displays each request with target info, requested by, and date. If none, reply "No pending promotion requests."
- Each request has inline buttons "Approve" | "Reject" (callback: `approve_promote_<request_id>` / `reject_promote_<request_id>`). Multiple requests can be displayed, each with its own buttons.
- Handling approve/reject updates promotion_requests status, adds/doesn't add to tc_admins, and logs as defined in Feature 4.

FEATURE 30: COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION AND EDGE CASES
- All commands that modify state (promote, demote, ban, unban, transfer, etc.) must validate the target and sender permissions as defined.
- Attempting to act on the owner (demote/ban) must be rejected with appropriate messages.
- When a command is issued without required arguments, the bot must reply with a usage hint (e.g., "Usage: /tcban <target> <reason>").
- For /tcban, if the reason is just empty spaces, treat it as missing.
- For paginated lists, ensure Next/Previous buttons only appear when there are more items.
- The bot should handle cases where it is not an admin in a federated group (e.g., cleanup) gracefully.
- When sending log messages, ensure the HTML is properly escaped and all tags are correct.

FEATURE 31: BOT MESSAGES AND TONE (FRIENDLY-FORMAL BLEND)
All bot messages must strike a balance between friendly and formal – warm but not slangy, respectful but not stiff. Use HTML for formatting where appropriate (bold, italic, etc.). No emoji. Below are the exact texts for various scenarios. The bot must use these exact messages (placeholders like <value> are filled dynamically).

FEATURE 33: MEMBER CACHE INITIALISATION
- When a new group becomes affiliated (Feature 1 step 3.c), the bot fetches all current members using get_chat_members_count and iterating with get_chat_member to obtain user_id, username, first_name, last_name. Store each in `member_cache` with last_updated = now.
- On every message received in any affiliated group, update the sender's entry in `member_cache` (upsert).
- On any `chat_member` update (new_chat_member or left_chat_member), update the cache accordingly.
- This keeps the bot's member data accurate for display in logs and information menus.
