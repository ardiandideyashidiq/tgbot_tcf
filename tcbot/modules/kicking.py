    "<b>Commands & Aliases</b>\n"
    "<code>/tckick</code> (alias: <code>/tck</code>)\n\n"

    "<b>Who can use it</b>\n"
    "Tester and above (Founder / Admin / Developer / Tester).\n\n"

    "<b>Where to use it</b>\n"
    "Inside any connected group.\n\n"

    "<b>What it does</b>\n"
    "Removes a user from the <b>current group only</b> - this is not a federation-wide action. "
    "The user can rejoin via an invite link unless they are separately federation-banned.\n\n"
    "If the target holds a federation role (Tester / Developer / Admin), that role is "
    "automatically removed and they are notified by DM. A log entry is posted to the "
    "federation logs channel.\n\n"

    "<b>Flow</b>\n"
    "1. Run <code>/tckick</code> with the target (and optional inline reason).\n"
    "2. If no reason was given, the bot asks - reply with text or tap <b>Skip</b>.\n"
    "3. The bot asks for proof - send a photo/video or tap <b>Skip</b> to kick without proof.\n\n"

    "<b>How to specify the target</b>\n"
    "Reply to a message, or provide a user ID / @username after the command.\n\n"

    "<b>Examples</b>\n"
    "<code>/tckick @username being disruptive</code> - reason inline\n"
    "<code>/tck 123456789</code> - bot will ask for reason\n"
    "Or reply to a message and run <code>/tck</code>."
